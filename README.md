## Overview

This package contains two very useful diagnostics for Markov Chain Monte Carlo:

1. `potential_scale_reduction(chains...)`, which estimates the potential scale reduction factor, also known as `Rhat`, for multiple scalar chains,

2. `effective_sample_size(chain)`, which calculates the effective sample size for scalar chains.

These are intended as *building blocks*, to be used by other libraries, and were organized into a separate library for testing and DRY.

## Installation

The package is registered. You can install it with

```julia
Pkg.add("MCMCDiagnostics")
```
